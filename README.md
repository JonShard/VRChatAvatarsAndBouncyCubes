# Avatars and bouncy cubes.
A basic VR Chat world containing a platform with a collection of avatars.

### What is VR Chat?
VR chat is a social game where the players meet in virtual worlds like this one to do anything 
from singing karaoke to playing cards against humanity or tick tack toe. It's works with and 
without a VR headset.

### What is this world?
Me getting familiar with the VR Chat SDK pretty much. A hobby project where I try to make 
mechanisms given pretty basic scripts. VR chat doesn't support scripting yet, so we use what is 
already in the SDK. This is my playground for making toys for VR Chat.

### Things in the world
- Avatars and some mirrors.
- Video player showing of some previous work.
- Cubes that bounce around a lot more than they should.
- A basement level accessable using player teleport buttons. It has pictures from fun times in 
the game,
- Some portals.
